# MicroFDM
Cheap, compact, mostly 3D printed FDM printer designed to be printable on an Ender 3.
</br>
Uses an upside-down design to be folded easily, and a coreXY architecture to be as compact as possible. This project is designed to reuse as much parts from an ender 3 after popular mods to reuse them, such as the motherboard and fans from a silent mod, extruder from a direct extrusion mod and others. In short, minimal amount of money wasted.
</br>
It's all printable on an ender 3 (mine modified but cant see why it wouldn't be possible on a stock one) so every printer will do fine, in theory in less than 1 kg of PETG (still not finished my roll with a lot of testing done. Expect around 400 gr of material if you have a low print failure rate. Everything that is not in this repository (some pulleys, timing belts & gears) are not my work and can be found on Thangs. I may get them here if their licences permit it. As everything is 3d printed on a classic bedslinger printer, I plan to have approx 100 x 100 x 100 mm of print space on the resultatn printer.

<ul> Bill of materials as of 03/05, everything is to be sourced on aliexpress:
<li> Some 8mm linear rods, preferably 2* 400 mm : about 10 €. You will need a saw to cut them.</li>
<li> 15 mm MGN12 linear rail : about 5€</li>
<li> 24V 3A PSU, about 12€</li>
<li> Creality ender 3 hotend : about 10€. If you modded your printer with a V6 hotend (or other), you already have it.</li>
<li> 1m of PTFE tubing : around 1€.</li>
<li> linear endless screw for the Z axis : around 5€</li>
<li> Titan extruder gear: about 2€. Stock creality extruder is extremely bad so I chose to redesign a printable titan extruder reusing parts of the crality one. It's my design, so it possibly sucks even more than the original creality, but there's always room for improvements.</li>
<li> Trianglelab MR85ZZ bearings for the extruder</li>
<li> Some LM8UU linear bearings : approx. 3€ for 2 bearings.</li>
<li> A motherboard. Mine is a creality 4.2.2, around 25€ if you buy it (don't) but any will do. If you've done a silent mod, you probably have one laying around.</li>
<li> Some fans: a 60mm 24V for PSU & motherboard, and a 40mm 24V for the hotend. Pro tip : 60 mm 24V fans can be found inside ender 3 PSUs, again you have one if you modded your ender 3 to be silent.</li>
<li> 4 stepper motors (3 axis and one extruder) : approx. 35€ for some weak pankakes ones, should be sufficient. Mine are Usongshine 17HS4023, as the extruder is a titan it doesn't require more torque.</li>
<li> You will probably need some terminal kits, it's about 3€ each. Add 25€ for special pliers, or just suffer for free through each connectors with regular pliers! Choose the second option, you don't need special crimping pliers.</li>
<li> Buy a screen and a knob if you needit (around 15€), but I will be running everything from a computer.</li>
<li> One bed sticker for the bed. Did not design the bed yet, so i'm not giving any references.</li>
<li> Ordered some other components for the Z axis too, but I haven't designed anything yet.</li>
<li> </li>
</ul>
